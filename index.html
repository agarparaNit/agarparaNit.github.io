The aim of the incubation centre would be to encourage the budding UG/PG students of NIT to take up the challenge of entrepreneurship as career. This would encourage innovation in thought process and professional skills/practices required for market survey, production and commercialization vis-à-vis to assist technology business start-ups in their nursery stage. Thus, the enthusiastic students coming with innovative or new ideas could be given proper platform to prepare appropriate scheme for translating their ideas into marketable product. Implementing an idea requires financial support; but, students in general, lack knowledge on the funding agencies and the processes involved to approach them. Moreover, even if someone succeeds to implement an innovative project with small investment, it would be difficult for him/her to protect the right for the idea or to commercialize the product to start a profitable business with that product. 
The proposed NIT incubation centre (NIC) is poised to provide the following services:<br>
1) To check and scrutinize the feasibility and commercial viability of the business idea or project plan submitted by any student(s).
